# 💭 Reflection - Olist Project

## 💡 What I Learned
- How to use **Tableau Actions** to create interactivity between different charts.
- Analyzing geographical data using **Map Visualizations**.
- The impact of logistics performance on customer reviews.

## 🚧 What Was Challenging
- Managing the relationships between 9 different tables without causing data duplication.
- Dealing with Portuguese column names and translating/understanding the context.

## 📈 Improvements
- I implemented **Parameters** in Tableau to allow users to switch between different metrics dynamically, adding more depth to the dashboard.
