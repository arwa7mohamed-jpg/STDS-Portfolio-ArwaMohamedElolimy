# 💭 Reflection - Pizza Sales

## 💡 What I Learned
- Mastering **DAX functions** like `CALCULATE`, `SUMX`, and `DATESYTD` to created advanced metrics.
- The importance of proper **Data Modeling** (Star Schema) to ensure the dashboard runs smoothly.

## 🚧 What Was Challenging
- formatting the visual elements to look consistent and professional.
- Creating a dynamic title that changes based on the selected slicer.

## 📈 Improvements
- I utilized **Tooltips** to show detailed information without cluttering the main view, which was an upgrade from my previous static reports.
