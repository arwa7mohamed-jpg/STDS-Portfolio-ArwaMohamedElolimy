# 💭 Reflection - Global Superstore Analysis

## 💡 What I Learned
- **Pivot Tables Mastery:** I learned how to use Excel Pivot Tables to quickly aggregate large datasets (over 50,000 rows) and extract summary statistics like those found in the `KPI.csv` file.
- **Time-Series Analysis:** Understanding how to group dates by "Month" and "Year" to visualize trends, as seen in the monthly sales analysis.
- **Data Granularity:** Learned the difference between analyzing data at a high level (Category) versus a granular level (Sub-Category like Phones vs. Copiers).

## 🚧 What Was Challenging
- **Data Inconsistencies:** The raw CSV file had some inconsistencies in date formats which required careful formatting before analysis could begin.
- **Choosing the Right Visualization:** Deciding whether to use a Bar Chart or a Line Chart for the monthly trends to best represent the fluctuation in profit.
- **Profit vs. Sales:** It was challenging to understand why some categories (like Furniture) had high sales but lower profit margins compared to Technology.

## 📈 Improvements
- **Better Data Structuring:** Compared to my initial attempts, I improved my ability to structure the data into separate analysis sheets (KPIs, Monthly Trends, Profit) for better readability.
- **Analytical Thinking:** I moved beyond just "showing numbers" to trying to understand *why* certain months perform better than others.
